Complementing online material for the paper "Investigating German Higher Education Institutions' Transfer Activities"

## Dictionary
The dictionary (list of keywords) contains all terms that were used to analyze the transfer activities of German higher education institutions (HEI) using texts from their websites. 

The full list of keywords is available in Excel (.xlsx) for easy usage and readability. Moreover, we provide the full list and the list of keywords for each category as text files (.txt).

We provide the core list (deductively generated) as well as the advanced list with AI-based additions. These lists enable other researchers to apply own changes and cleaning to the keywords. 
Moreover, we provide the stemmed version of the advanced list. This list was used in our research project.

More details are provided in the readme files of the directories.
